# ReviewReview

This is a review browser for a popular e-commerce website that rhymes with "ham along". It can be used to follow specific reviewers and read their thoughts in an RSS reader-like UI.

## Why?

My husband and I have made a habit out of reading hilarious product reviews together. However, we have found that a particular web store, perhaps deliberately, has been making our hobby more difficult. This project aims to streamline and enhance our review-reviewing experience.
